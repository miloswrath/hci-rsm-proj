## Title of Study: Evaluating the Impact of AI-Generated Captions on Caregiver Decision-Making Using MyChart Visualizations

#### Principal Investigator: Zachary Gilliam

#### Under Supervision of: Dr. Juan Pablo Hourcade

#### Institution: University of Iowa

**Purpose of the Study:** You are being invited to participate in a research study that aims to evaluate whether incorporating AI-generated contextual captions into MyChart visualizations can enhance caregiver decision-making and reduce stress compared to traditional data visualization formats. The goal of this study is to improve the accessibility and comprehension of healthcare information, ultimately supporting caregivers in making more informed healthcare decisions.

**Procedures:** If you decide to participate, you will be asked to engage in three different types of interactions involving healthcare information: (1) data visualizations alone, (2) AI-generated contextual captions alone, and (3) a combination of both data visualizations and AI-generated captions. You will assume the role of a caregiver for a family member with cognitive impairments and will be asked to make decisions regarding the course of treatment based on provided test results. The study will be conducted either in-person or remotely via video conferencing, and the entire session is expected to last approximately 20 minutes.
