Stress Appraisals of Acute Stress (SAAS)
Instructions:
1.	The first questionnaire is used as a pre-task appraisal assessment and is given immediately before a task begins, but after instructions are provided so participants know what the task is, but have not done it yet.
2.	The post-task questionnaire is given immediately after the task. 
In general, we find pre-task appraisals are more predictive of physiologic responses during the first minute of the task. Post-task appraisals tend to be more correlated with personality measures like neuroticism.

Scoring:
1.	Check the alpha of the demand and resource items. Only create scales of items that hang together > .70. The typical item that tends not to result in a high alpha that we end up dropping from the resource scale is the control item (#12). We have kept this in the scale simply because it theoretically should be part of resources.
2.	Threat ratio is created by diving demands by resources (demands/resources). Others have subtracted: demands – resources.
3.	Items #9, #10 and #11 are not part of demands and resources. Expectations are considered separately, and the questions that ask whether participants felt “challenged” or “threatened” were added to demonstrate that the common language labels attached to these categories based on Lazarus and Folkman’s theory, do not translate into the same responses as the indexes of demands and resources. Researchers are advised not to use the common language questions if they are trying to differentiate “challenge” and “threat” stress states.
