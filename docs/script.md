### Introduction and Consent

**Investigator Introduction** : The investigator will introduce themselves and explain the purpose of the study. Participants will be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they can withdraw at any time.

Consent Process: The investigator will provide an informed consent form, which participants will review and sign electronically before proceeding.

**Script**:
"Hello, my name is Zachary Gilliam, and I will be guiding you through todayâ€™s study. Thank you for taking the time to participate. Before we begin, I want to remind you that your participation is completely voluntary, and you are free to withdraw at any point. I will now provide you with an informed consent form. Please take a few moments to read through it, and let me know if you have any questions. Once you are ready, you can sign it electronically so that we can proceed."

### Baseline Questionnaire

Participants will complete a short pre-screening questionnaire to confirm demographic information, caregiving experience, and familiarity with patient portals. This information will NOT be used to validate participant eligibility.

**Script**:
"Thank you for signing the consent form. Next, I will ask you to complete a short questionnaire that will help us gather some baseline information about your caregiving experience and your familiarity with healthcare portals. This should take about 5 minutes."

### Experimental Interaction

Overview of Scenarios: The investigator will provide an overview of the three interaction types: (1) data visualizations alone, (2) AI-generated contextual captions alone, and (3) a combination of both.

Scenario Presentation: Participants will be presented with a simulated patient scenario based on synthetic data generated from the Synthea dataset. The investigator will guide participants through each interaction type, one at a time, allowing them to experience all three variations.

**Script**:
"You will now be presented with three different types of healthcare information visualizations. In each scenario, you will be playing the role of a caregiver for a family member with cognitive impairments. The information you see will be based on realistic healthcare data. I will guide you through each scenario, and I encourage you to think aloud as you review the visualizations and captions."

#### Scenario 1: Data Visualizations Alone

Participants will be debriefed on the scenario and the data visualizations and then take the SAAS pre-task questionnaire.

Participants will be shown data visualizations, such as bar charts or line graphs depicting laboratory results.

They will be asked to interpret the information and decide on a course of action for the patient.

They will take the SAAS post-task questionnaire

**Script**:
"In this first scenario, you will see a traditional data visualization of your family member's lab results. Please take your time to review the information and tell me what decisions you would make regarding the patient's care. Feel free to ask any questions if you need clarification. Before you begin, I will ask you to take a short questionnaire to assess your stress levels and decision-making confidence."

#### Scenario 2: AI-Generated Contextual Captions Alone

Participants will be debriefed on the scenario and the data visualizations and then take the SAAS pre-task questionnaire.

Participants will be presented with AI-generated text-only explanations of the patient's lab results, without any visualizations.

They will be asked to interpret the information and make caregiving decisions.

They will take the SAAS post-task questionnaire

**Script**:
"In this second scenario, you will see AI-generated explanations of the patient's lab results, without any visual aids. Please read through the information carefully and let me know what you would decide for the patient's care. Before you begin, I will ask you to take a short questionnaire to assess your stress levels and decision-making confidence."

#### Scenario 3: Combined Data Visualizations and AI-Generated Captions

Participants will be debriefed on the scenario and the data visualizations and then take the SAAS pre-task questionnaire.

Participants will view a combination of data visualizations and AI-generated captions.

They will again be asked to interpret the information and decide on a course of action.

They will take the SAAS post-task questionnaire

**Script**:
"In this final scenario, you will see a combination of both visual data and AI-generated captions. This approach is designed to provide both graphical and contextual explanations. Please take your time to interpret the information and share your thoughts on what actions you would take."

### Post-Scenario Questionnaire

After completing each scenario, participants will be asked to complete a short questionnaire assessing their perceived stress, understanding of the information, and confidence in their decision-making. They will also take the acute perceived stress scale (see appendix)

**Script**:
"Thank you for reviewing the scenarios. I will now ask you to complete a short questionnaire to reflect on your experience, including how stressful you found the information and how confident you feel about your decisions."

### Debriefing

Debriefing: The investigator will provide a brief summary of the study's goals and answer any questions participants may have.

** cript** : "Thank you so much for your participation today. This study aims to explore how different types of healthcare data presentations can support caregivers in making decisions. If you have any questions about the study or would like more information, feel free to ask.  Thanks again for your time
